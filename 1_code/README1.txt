AustinCox_LEDatabase.sql is SQL file that was created in MySQL Workbench, and as such needs to be opened inside 
MySQL Workbench. Proper Configuration of the correct port for the server is necessary for
the script to run properly. This file is now outdated, due to updated records since it's use. 
Instead use "Dump.sql" for Data Import on MySQL Workbench to allow all current tables and records to be inserted into the database.
