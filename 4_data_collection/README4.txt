Data collection for this program involves the use of "linked tables" via the use of an ODBC connector, and will mirror all actions taken on the front-end and reflect them in realtime on the actual MySQL database. This also provides an extra layer of security in case of data corruption on the Microsoft Access Front-End, because all of the records are backed up on the MySQL Community Server.
